# CodeIgniter4 - Web Portal for Payroll Management System
<br>

This uncomplicated initiative entails the creation of an Employee Payroll Management Systemâ€”a web-centric application crafted using PHP, the CodeIgniter 4 Framework, and MySQL Database. The primary objective of this project is to furnish a streamlined and online platform for a specific company to oversee the payroll and payslips of its employees efficiently. This system empowers the company's management to effortlessly store, retrieve, and administer employees' payslips. With a visually appealing user interface facilitated by the Bootstrap 5 Framework, the application aims to enhance the end-user experience by delivering user-friendly features and functionalities.

This project was developed using the following:
- XAMPP
- PHP version >= 8
- MySQL Database
- CodeIgniter 4 Framework
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Ajax
- Bootstrap Framework
<br>
Access to the Employees Payroll Management System Project is restricted to the company's management. Users must log in using valid credentials to unlock the system's features and functionalities. Registration of system users is exclusively handled by another user with existing access to the system. The CodeIgniter Project comes pre-loaded with default admin user credentials during seeding.
The project boasts a variety of features and functionalities, including Departments, Designation, Employees, Payrolls, and Payslips Management. Each feature incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionalities, with pagination features implemented to optimize data loading on pages in the future. The Employee List is equipped with a Search Box, facilitating easy retrieval of employee data by searching based on partial employee code or name.
For Payslip Generation, users must first create a new payroll before generating a payslip entry for an employee. The payslip page automatically calculates the total Net amount for the employee, considering Attendance, Earnings, Deductions, and Tax data specific to the selected payroll or cut-off period. Additionally, users have the option to print employees' payslips.
